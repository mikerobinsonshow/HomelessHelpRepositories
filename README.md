# HomelessHelpRepositories

HomelessHelpResources This is a website to help people who are in need of emergency resources in NYC.
This simple UI website can be accessed by LinkNYC terminals, and shows an aggregated list and map of nearby shelters, health clinics and free legal help. 

There are many resources in New York City, but they are spread across public and private organizations. Even public city resources can be provided by multiple redundant organizations, and finding that information within NYC.gov website can be cumbersome for someone who is recently street homeless. This website aims to streamline that information.
